== Welcome to Liceknjiga

Liceknjiga is a web-application that I made as part of one project on my faculty. It's a photo sharing social network which supports adding friends, tagging, comments, likes and privacy.

Here's a link to video showing how I did it: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmDXdFjQtzM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmDXdFjQtzM)
